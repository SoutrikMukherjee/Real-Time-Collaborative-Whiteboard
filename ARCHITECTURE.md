# Architecture Overview

## System Design

This platform implements a distributed real-time collaboration system with the following components:

### Frontend (SvelteKit)
- Handles UI rendering and user interactions
- Manages local state with stores
- Implements optimistic updates for better UX
- Uses IndexedDB for offline storage

### WebSocket Server
- Manages real-time connections
- Broadcasts operations to connected clients
- Implements room-based isolation
- Handles presence updates (cursors, user status)

### Operational Transform Engine
- Resolves conflicts between concurrent operations
- Maintains operation history
- Ensures eventual consistency

### Redis Layer
- Session management
- Pub/Sub for horizontal scaling
- Operation queue for reliability
- Temporary state caching

### Supabase Backend
- User authentication (JWT-based)
- Persistent storage (PostgreSQL)
- Real-time subscriptions
- Row-level security policies
